# WQU-Unit-2-Machine-Learning-and-Statistical-Analysis

This repository contains my solutions to the mini-projects given by [World Quant University](https://wqu.org/) as part of their [Applied Data Science Module](https://wqu.org/programs/data-science) (Unit II).
In this unit, they helped me to develop machine learning and statistical analysis skills through hands-on practice with open-ended investigations of real-world data.

[ML Miniproject](https://github.com/ajaykumarr28/WQU-Unit-2-Machine-Learning-and-Statistical-Analysis/blob/master/ml.ipynb) - The objective of this mini-project is to exercise my ability to create effective machine learning models for making predictions.

[NLP Miniproject](https://github.com/ajaykumarr28/WQU-Unit-2-Machine-Learning-and-Statistical-Analysis/blob/master/nlp.ipynb) - The objective of this mini-project is to gain experience with natural language processing and how to use text data to train a machine learning model to make predictions.
