# WQU-Unit-2-Machine-Learning-and-Statistical-Analysis

This repository contains my solutions to the mini-projects given by World Quant University as part of their [Applied Data Science Module](https://wqu.org/programs/data-science) (Unit II).
In this unit, they helped me to develop machine learning and statistical analysis skills through hands-on practice with open-ended investigations of real-world data.
